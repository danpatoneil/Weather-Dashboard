# Weather Dashboard

## Weather Dashboard
 This website allows trip planners to check weather forecasts in multiple locations at once. It uses Javascript to call openweather api for the weather data it prints, and uses jquery for DOM traversal and dayJS for date/time representations.

 ## Installation
This application runs in your browser and does not require installation.

Here is a screenshot and a link to the running website

![a screenshot of the website. It shows the search bar, an empty current weather section and an empty 5-Day forecast section.](screenshot.png)

 ## Use
This project allows users to quickly and concisely call upon weather info from several locations and represent the current weather and 5 day forecast for those places in a highly readable way and easily tab between their other recent searches.


 ## Future iterations
In future, I would like the project to include functionality to save your five most recent searches to local storage and automatically load them. Once I understand geolocation better, this project could also pull the user's current location and run weather reports on that as well.
